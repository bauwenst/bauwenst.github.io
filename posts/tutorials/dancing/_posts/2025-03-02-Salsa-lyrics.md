As a beginning leader, all you care about in the music is the count. Yet, as [David Linares](https://sonycasino.com/2015/06/04/musicality-how-to-tell-when-some-songs-are-about-to-end/) blogged about almost a decade ago, and as was recently reiterated by [Steven Messina](https://youtu.be/Uyq3--7FPdw?t=0) and [Robin Campbell](https://youtu.be/GC3UnguZdu0?t=55), a good leader conditions his figures and positions on the energy of the music. I will go one step further and argue that true musicality requires that your dance follows the emotion expressed by the lyrics. So, let's learn some Spanish lyrics.

1. dummy
{:toc}

Below, I've selected several popular salsa songs which I also like dancing to. For each of them, I want to document the **story** it tells, and also give you the key lines (usually a chorus or exclamations) which you can sing on the floor -- without losing count, which is trickier than you'd think even if you have no issue finding count on these songs.

Of course, I don't speak Spanish, and because I don't want to bother the handful of Spanish-speaking friends I have, I will paste the lyrics into ChatGPT so it has all the context it needs for a lyrical analysis (a task which is not uncommon, just like the Spanish language, so it should have no problem understanding what to do and doing it correctly). My initial prompt:

> I'm going to give you the lyrics to several Spanish songs. Your job is to tell me, in English, the story the song is telling us. You don't have to translate the entire song, but please do cite the key phrases that indicate what the rest of the song revolves around.

# Pastilla de Menta (Havana D'Primera)
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4kh7zU2CeQtLLL91ZNn2FA?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

## Story
According to ChatGPT:
> The narrator is defending and celebrating his music (his timba), despite gossip or criticism. (...) The phrase "pastilla de menta" (a breathmint) may be a metaphor, possibly for something refreshing, soothing, or spicy, depending on context. Could be slang for his musical flavor — like saying, "Here’s something fresh for you."

## Key lyrics
> Mira mi timba, que bien se ve.<br>
> Ven, tirat' una foto.

- **Translation:**<br>
"Look at my timba, how good it looks.<br>
Come, take yourself a photo."

> Prepárate,<br>
> apúntate,<br>
> menéate.<br>
> Un, dos, tres, camina!

- **Translation:**<br>
"Prepare yourself,<br>
join in,<br>
sway your body.<br>
One, two, three, let's go!"

> Heh, hah, agítala,<br>
> jala por aquí, jala por allá,<br>
> levanta la mano y mueva la cintura,<br>
> salta! Dale pa'que vuelv'a 'mpezar.

- **Grammar:** The last sentence is hard to translate. It starts with *dale* (literally "give it"), a phrase that means "go for it", and then *pa'que* (*para que*, "for the reason that"), *vuelva* ("it comes back around") and *a empezar* ("to start").
- **Translation:**<br>
"Hey, hah, shake it,<br>
pull over here, pull over there,<br>
raise your hand and move your waist,<br>
jump! Do it now, so we can start over."

## Musicality
The final excerpt describes a little dance routine which you can try to integrate into your dance. To get an idea, [here is Havana D'Primera](https://youtu.be/Rb2BwJwTIi0?t=150) performing the song in concert. It repeats four times back-to-back after the bridge, and you can have a lot of fun even with the *"salta!"* alone.

The only source I could find for the lyrics was a [lyric video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlrW2WI_O9Q), so I transcribed it.

## Story
According to ChatGPT:
> The central speaker is addressing a partner (likely a girlfriend) who has **acted out socially**, causing embarrassment, making scenes, and behaving inappropriately in public.

## Key lyrics
In all of the below, don't pronounce the letter "s". This is typical for Caribbean Spanish.

> tu te salvas porque tu me gustas<br>
> pero no te vistas que estas castiga'

- **Translation:**<br>
"You redeem yourself because I like you<br>
but don't get dressed, because you're in time-out."

> y la lleve al Aljibe<br>
> (y se comio to' el pollo)<br>
> la lleve a casa de Teresa<br>
> (se tomo la cerveza)<br>
> y la lleve al chachacha<br>
> (y no dejo na)

- **Translation:**<br>
"And I took her to the Reservoir<br>
(and she ate all their chicken)<br>
I took her to Teresa's house<br>
(she drank her beer)<br>
and I took her to cha-cha-cha<br>
(and she left nothing)."

> Por eso no vas.

- **Translation:** "For that reason, you're not coming along."

# Qué Pasa Loco (Issac Delgado)
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/5evx5is4W5iLY7A5zv82Ut?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

## Story
According to ChatGPT:
> This song tells the story of a man who is deeply attracted to a young woman, to the point of obsession. Despite being "mature and conscious" of his situation, he finds himself losing control and experience when it comes to her. However, his friends (or his own inner voice) are warning him to stop, insisting that she is not for him.

I slightly disagree with this; I believe the song is about the narrator telling another guy to back off from a woman he is interested in himself. Hence the line *Es un consejo de amigo, lo que te voy a decir: que no te vuelvas medio-loco con esa niña, que no es para ti, la quiero para mí.* ("It is friendly advice, that which I'm going to tell you: don't become half-crazy with that girl, since she's not for you, her I want for myself.")

## Key lyrics
> Loco, <br>
> que pasa loco? <br>
> Controlate muchacho, <br>
> que esa niña n' e' pa'ti.

- **Grammar:** *n' e' pa'* in the song is pronounced "nwepa" and is short for *no es para* ("is not for").
- **Translation:**<br>
"Madman,<br>
what's up madman?<br>
Control yourself dude,<br>
because that girl is not (meant) for you."

## Musicality
This song fools every leader the first couple times. It has four different points where it pretends to end: 2:47, 3:08, 4:44, and most deviously, 5:10. Remember that **this song ends with a fade-out**. It does not end by stopping dead in its tracks. Keep dancing when it does, because there's more to come!

# La Chica Chocolate (Barbaro Fines y su Mayimbe)
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4x63ATVTkH4p48gHOtBpUA?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>
This song is my all-time favourite rueda song. Barbaro Fines's drummer deserves an award for the insane energy he brings to this.

## Story
According to ChatGPT:
> This song is a tribute to a girl dubbed "la chica chocolate" (the chocolate girl), admired for her irresistible looks and seductive dance moves. (...) "Chocolate" refers to her skin tone -- it's a common, affectionate way to describe a beautiful black or brown-skinned woman.

From what I can tell myself, this song's lyrics are either very explicitly sexual, or alternatively, they are trying to be funny by serenading an actual liquid-inside chocolate figure which they are about to consume. I made ChatGPT start doubting itself by asking about the sexual nature of the metaphors, so it did not help me figure out which interpretation is correct.

## Key lyrics
> Mamita ven,<br>
> que tu esta' pa' chuparte toda, el chocolate ma' rico, mami.

- **Pronunciation:** "tu estas" is pronounced "twesta" here.
- **Grammar:** *ven* is the imperative of *venir* ("to come") and "que" here is meant as "because". Interestingly, *chupar* ("to take in", "to suck") here has a direct pronoun *te* because *tu estas para chupar* would mean "you are (made) to take in", where *tu* becomes the subject of this *para*.
- **Translation:**<br>
"Come here, lil' momma,<br>
because you're made to be taken in whole, the chocolate so very rich, mommy"

> Mano' pal cielo!<br>
> Todas las chicas chocolates que vinieron, a ver!

- **Translation:**<br>
"Hands to the sky!<br>
All the chocolate girls that showed up, let's see!"

> Tú tienes que tener presente<br>
> que Mayimbe suena diferente.<br>
> Porque mi música es la que siente,<br>
> y hace gozar a toda la gente.<br><br>
> Salte del medio, demente.<br>
> Mejor evit'un accidente.<br>
> Dedicat' a tu musiquita, y a tun-tun-tun

- **Translation:**<br>
"You have to keep top-of-mind<br>
that the Boss sounds different.<br>
Because my music is that which feels,<br>
and makes everyone enjoy themselves.<br><br>
Get out of the way, lunatic.<br>
Better avoid an accident.<br>
Dedicate yourself to your little music, and to tun-tun-tun."

> Ella, lo que tiene 's chocolate en 'l cuerpo.

- **Translation:**<br>
"She, that which she has is chocolate in her body."

> Que rico seria pasarte la lenguïta por tu barriguita, cosita rica.

- **Translation:**<br>
"How rich it would be to pass my tongue over your stomach, you savoury little thing."<br>

## Musicality
If you are the cantante for a rueda to this song, there are several moments you can exploit for extra effect. (All credit for this goes to [DJ El Guapo](https://www.instagram.com/el_guapo1906/), whom I suggested do a rueda to this song I had just discovered, and who proceeded to nail every single accent.)

At 2:25, the music rests for 20 seconds so that it can come back with even more energy at 2:45. I recommend against calling any partner changes in these 20 seconds (keeping the rueda stagnant) and allow *guapea* in the truest sense of the word, which is to say, have everyone show off with their partner using the accents in the music. Then, at 2:45, you call any enchufla-based figure (like *festival de pelotas*) to ramp up the movement of the rueda.

The same is true between 5:40 and 6:35 to prepare for the final minute of the song.

At 3:35, I recommend you call *cintura*, i.e. the couples let go and rotate while girating the hips. You can keep doing this for all four phrases and then call a *dame*.

# Abre Que Voy (Miguel Enriquez)
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1v0749CQ2jCJwY9NF48u6R?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

## Story
According to ChatGPT:
> It seems like he's speaking to someone at the party or event where salsa is going to take place, (...) inviting them to open the door (literally or metaphorically) and let him in. (...) He's asking the door to be opened because he's ready to enter with excitement or force. The phrase is a playful, metaphorical way to say, "I'm coming in strong and full of energy—let me in!"

## Key lyrics
> Salseros: si llaman, yo vengo!

- **Translation:** 
"Salsa dancers: when they call, I come!"

> Yo se que te gusta, t'estoy encantando.<br>
> Abreme la puerta, que vengo gozando.<br>
> Yo se que te gusta, yo se que t'encanta.<br>
> Abreme la puerta, que vengo 'pretando.

- **Grammar:** *que* here doesn't refer to *la puerta*, but means "'cause". The gerund *gozando* comes from *gozar* ("to have a great time"). Meanwhile, *'pretando* is short for *apretrando*, about which ChatGPT says: "The word "apretando" comes from "apretar", which generally means "to tighten" or "to put pressure". However, in this context, it is often used colloquially in music, especially in genres like salsa, to imply that he's coming with a strong or powerful presence -- he's bringing a lot of intensity, excitement, and rhythm."
- **Translation:**<br>
"I know that you like it, I'm enchanting to you.<br>
Open the door for me, because I come with excitement.<br>
I know that you like it, I know that I enchant you. <br>
Open the door for me, because I come with force."

> Abre, que voy!

- **Translation:**
"Open up, here I come!"

> Tun tun. Quien es?

- **Translation:**
"Knock knock. Who's there?"

# Marcando la Distancia (Manolito y su Trabuco)
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/70BDblSjPfj6Pe24avWzK2?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

## Story
According to ChatGPT:
> This song is about a confrontation between the narrator and someone (likely an ex [of his girlfriend]) who has come to his house, trying to reclaim a woman who is no longer his. (...) The narrator is saying *"Tu pa' lla' y yo pa' ca' para marcar la distancia",* and he’s saying it to the ex. The phrase translates to "You go that way, and I go this way to mark the distance," meaning the narrator is telling the ex to leave and establish a clear separation between them. He is asserting boundaries and marking that the ex is no longer involved in the woman’s life.

## Key lyrics
> Tu pa'lla, y yo pa'ca.

- **Grammar:** *pa'lla* and *pa'ca* are short for *para allá* and *para acá*. Spanish has the words *aqui/acá* for "here exactly" and "around here", and the words *ahi/alli/alla* for "there, a couple steps away" and "there, where I'm pointing" and "there, in those faraway lands".
- **Translation:** "You (go) over there, and I (stay) over here."

> Pa' la calle, fuera de mi casa.

- **Translation:** "Into the street, out of my house."

# Mira Como Se Mueve (Manolito Simonet y su Trabuco)
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4f4mYVxaveNdOoGlyhRa6M?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

## Story
Based on just the chorus, ChatGPT says:
> The chorus is describing a girl who’s dancing wildly and passionately, impressing those around her with her moves. The narrator is reacting with surprise and admiration.

## Key lyrics
There exist no lyrics for this song anywhere, so I had to piece them together with help from an Argentinian friend.

> Ai dios, <br>
> la niña 'sta violenta. <br>
> Mira como se mueve, <br>
> mira como calienta.

- **Grammar:** *violenta* is used figuratively to mean something like "coming at you hard", "striking". *calienta* is not an adjective or an adverb (that would be *caliente*), but a verb form, from *calentar* ("to heat").
- **Translation:**<br>
"Oh God, <br>
the girl is wild.<br>
Look at how she moves,<br>
look at how she heats it up."

> Pa' la pista, pa' la pista, todo el que vino pa' la pista.<br>
> Pa' la pista, pa' la pista, bailadores pa' la pista.

- **Translation:**<br>
"To the dance floor, to the dance floor, everyone who came, to the dance floor.<br>
To the floor, to the floor, dancers, to the dance floor.

> Muevelo, muevelo.

- **Grammar:** *mueve* is the imperative of *mover* ("to move").
- **Translation:** "Move it, move it."

> Muevelo, muevelo, muevelo.<br>
> Mirala, mirala, mirala.

- **Translation:** <br>
"Move it, move it, move it. <br>
Look at her, look at her, look at her."

# Me liberé (El Gran Combo De Puerto Rico)
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1IcnHHfeAkdc88LybFWwb9?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

## Story
According to ChatGPT:
> The narrator expresses relief and gratitude for freeing himself from various women who caused him emotional or relational stress, (...) breaking free from complicated relationships, particularly with women who are demanding or possessive. 

Although the song sounds like it's a cry for help to non-Spanish-speakers ("Free me!"), it's actually euphorically in past tense ("I freed myself!").

## Key lyrics
> Me liberé, me liberé,<br>
> gracias a Dios, me liberé.<br>
> Me liberé, me liberé,<br>
> gracias al cielo, me liberé.

- **Grammar:** *liberé* is the 1st-person singular simple past of *liberar*.
- **Translation:**<br>
"I freed myself, I freed myself,<br>
thank God, I freed myself.<br>
I freed myself, I freed myself,<br>
thank heavens, I freed myself."

> Que yo no quiero más complicaciones, por eso me liberé.<br>
> Me libére, me libére.

- **Translation:**<br>
"That I don't want more complications, for that I freed myself.<br>
I freed myself, I freed myself."

## Musicality
The last excerpt above appears towards the end of the song. Between the two lines, there is a burst of the orchestra. Try to anticipate this hit (which you can't do by the lyrics alone, because the first line appears earlier in the song) and exaggerate your movement at that moment.

# Después de todo (Juan Formell y Los Van Van)
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/4IDiFHGCutb8eNZYEBxHOV?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

## Story
The singer decries that she was broken up with. In the first half of the song, she asks why. When the song opens up, she tries to make the statement that "fine, if this is what you want, I don't want you anymore anyway".

## Key lyrics
> Y despues de todo que,<br>
> roto el sentimiento.<br>
> Para que, y por que, mi amor?<br>
> Di por mi: "Lo siento."

- **Grammar:** *despues de* means "after". *roto* is the past participle of *romper* ("to break"). *Lo siento* means "I'm sorry".
- **Translation:**<br>
"And after all of that,<br>
broken (is) the feeling.<br>
For what, and why, my love?<br>
Say sorry for me."

> Y despues de todo que,<br>
> todo es amargura.<br>
> Tu de cama en cama y yo,<br>
> y yo durmiendo sola.

- **Translation:**<br>
"And after all of that,<br>
everything has become bitter.<br>
You from bed to bed, and I,<br>
I'm sleeping on my own."

> No se vig'len -- no s'atormenten más, <br>
> que cada cual tiene s'suplente ya.

- **Grammar:** In Latin-American Spanish, the plural imperative (unlike the singular imperative) always addresses the **formal** "you", regardless of the situation. Like with German's *Sie*, this formal "you" uses the **third**-person conjugation of a verb. That means that in Latin America, a plural imperative uses the third-person plural of a verb, despite being meant for the people being addressed: *se vig'len* is short for *se vigilen*, the 3rd-person plural of *vigilar* ("to watch closely"), here reflexively "don't introspect for too long". Same holds for *se atornmenten* and *atormentar* ("to torment"). In Spain, people would use the 2nd-person plural imperatives *no os vigiléis* and *no os atornmentéis* instead. *cada cual* means "every one". *suplente* is a noun meaning "replacement".
- **Translation:**<br>
"Don't worry -- don't torment yourselves any more, <br>
'cause everyone has their replacement already."

> Lo que pasó, pasó, 'ta bueno ya -- <br>
> no comenten más, ya pasó.

- **Grammar:** *esta bueno ya* literally means "it is good already" but is said when you are annoyed by something and want it to end. In my native language, we would say *nu is het wel geweest* which translates to "now it has been good".
- **Translation:**<br>
"That which has happened, happened, that's enough -- <br>
don't comment any more, it's happened already.

# Azowano (Havana D'Primera)
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/1ebkv7RBt8pNn8qJ6rA5QN?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

This song is quite difficult to dance to, but the instrumentation is beautiful. It is technically a prayer, so we should be sensitive singing it appropriately.

## Story
According to ChatGPT:
> This song is a religious tribute to San Lázaro (Babalú-Ayé), a highly revered figure in Cuban popular and Afro-Caribbean spiritual traditions, especially within Santería and related belief systems like Arará. (...) The song tells the mythic-spiritual story of San Lázaro, syncretized with Babalú-Ayé, the orisha (Yoruba deity) of illness and healing. In Catholicism, San Lázaro is associated with leprosy and suffering. In Santería, Babalú-Ayé is the orisha who punishes and cures diseases—especially epidemics and skin conditions. (...) The lyrics narrate his suffering (covered in sores, walking with crutches), his resurrection or healing, and the guidance he receives from other orishas like Elegguá, Changó, Obatalá, and Orula—each with their own divine roles (e.g., fate, wisdom, purity, power).

## Key lyrics
> Azowano, ashé mi Babalú.<br>
> Aquí estamos los Cubanos,<br>
> pidiéndote salud, salud, salud.

- **Translation:**<br>
"Azowano, power to you, my Babalu.<br>
Here are the Cubans,<br>
begging you for good health, good health, good health."

> San Lázaro bendito,<br>
> ya puede caminar.<br>
> Ya tiene dos muletas,<br>
> ya puede caminar.

- **Translation:**<br>
"Saint Lazarus, blessed one,<br>
already he can walk again.<br>
Already he is carrying two crutches,<br>
already he can walk again."

# Ya Tu No Coronas (Maykel Blanco Y su Salsa Mayor)
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3rhuPie2HVWD1yJ8NASOCV?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

## Story
According to ChatGPT:
> The phrase "Ya tú no coronas" is key to understanding the song's meaning. In this context, "coronar" is [Caribbean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean_Spanish) slang for "to succeed" or "to win", especially in romantic or sexual conquests. So the title roughly means "You don't win anymore" or "You're not the champion anymore." <br>The song is about a love triangle where the narrator taunts another man, telling him that the woman he thinks he has isn't truly his. She still thinks about the narrator and even fakes affection for the other guy.

## Key lyrics
> Si te gu'tó como te besó, <br>
> entérate que'l que l'enseñó fui yo.<br>
> Ell' e' práctica, e' viva,<br>
> y no 'tá pa'la bobería.

- **Translation:**<br>
"If you liked how she kissed you,<br>
understand that the one who taught her was me.<br>
She's experienced, she's sharp,<br>
and she's not here for silly games."

> Ay ay ay, coge la cola <br>
> Ay ay ay, ya tú no coronas

- **Translation:**<br>
"Ay ay ay, get to the back of the line.<br>
Ay ay ay, no longer do you prevail."

# Brujeria (El Gran Combo De Puerto Rico)

## Story
According to ChatGPT:
> This song tells the story of a man who believes he has been enchanted—or cursed—by a woman. He is completely captivated by her, to the point of obsession, and suspects that she has used some kind of magic or witchcraft to make him fall for her.

## Key lyrics
> Tu m'hiciste brujeria.

- **Grammar:** *m'* is short for *me*. *hiciste* is the past 2nd singular of *hacer* ("to do").
- **Translation:** "You did witchcraft to me."


# Chupa Mi Melao (Nic N'Taya)
<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/3QcftrZy52znkV83nCB5A7?utm_source=generator&theme=0" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

The key lyric for this song also feature prominently at the end of *La Reventaya*, a medley of N'Taya songs.

## Key lyrics
